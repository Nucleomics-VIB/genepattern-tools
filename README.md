==========

Â©GenePattern is a product of the [Broad Institute](http://software.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/genepattern)

*All tools presented below have only been tested by me and may contain bugs, please let me know if you find some.

Please refer to the accompanying **[wiki](https://github.com/Nucleomics-VIB/genepattern-tools/wiki)** for examples and workflows.

## **scripts**

They were made to perform tasks not possible using the GenePattern GUI. <i>Specific features used in our code depend on the presence of executables or system resources that may be absent on your server.</i>

### **example**

The script **[GP_cliApp-wrapper.pl](scripts/GP_cliApp-wrapper.pl)** is derived from GenePattern provided wrappers and offers basic functionalities needed to create a perl wrapper with IO and error control. You can use it as start point to develop standard wrappers of your own.

## **modules**

You will find in that folder the zip archives of our modules that can be imported in your GP instance. Some module include a wrapper script (see comments above) while others rely solely on the GUI and on dependencies (to be!) installed on the server.

### **module Info**

The module **[Picard.2.template.v1.0.zip](https://github.com/Nucleomics-VIB/genepattern-tools/blob/master/modules/Picard.2.template.v1.0.zip?raw=true)** can be cloned and used as ba  sis for various Picard modules. It includes basic options and validation arguments often combined to picard commands.
