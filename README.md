==========

Â©GenePattern is a product of the [Broad Institute](http://software.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/genepattern)

*All tools presented below have only been tested by me and may contain bugs, please let me know if you find some. Each tool relies on dependencies normally listed at the top of the code (cpan for perl and cran for R will help you add them)*

Please refer to the accompanying **[wiki](https://github.com/Nucleomics-VIB/ngs-tools/wiki)** for examples and workflows.

NB: <i>Specific features used in our code depend on teh presence of executables or system resources that may be absent on your server.</i>

## **scripts**

They were made to perform tasks not possible using the GenePattern GUI. They often depend on installed applications which you will need to make available on your own server.

### **example**

The script **[GP_cliApp-wrapper.pl](scripts/GP_cliApp-wrapper.pl)** is derived from GenePattern provided wrappers and offers basic functionalities needed to create a perl wrapper with IO and error control. You can use it as start point to develop standard wrappers of your own.

## **modules**

You will find in that folder the zip archives of our modules that can be imported in your GP instance. Some module include a wrapper script (see comments above) while others rely solely on the GUI and on dependencies installed on the server.

### **module Info**

The module **[Picard.2.template.v1.0.zip](modules/Picard.2.template.v1.0.zip)** can be cloned and used as ba  sis for various Picard modules. It includes basic options and validation arguments often combined to picard commands.
